Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills

# Welcome to the bamazonapp!
### This app was created for classroom purposes! 
## bamazonapp is an app used for the customer to view & purchase items within the items list! 
### Instructions to use this app are as follows:
1. The app is used on the command-line or terminal. 
A dummy database with prefilled information has been provided in order to demonstrate.
* On start the customer is shown a table of what items can be purchased! 

* The first question is  ****"What would you like to purchase today in our store? (Note: Please type your selection!)"****
the customer at this time types an id number which prompts the next question.

Once the table loads the user is asked to select an item id number that represents the item the customer would like to purchase.  ****"How many would you like to purchase?",****
* Once asked the question the customer would then enter a number and the program will check to see if the number requested is over or less than what is in stock! 

* The last question asked is ****"Would you like to purchase something else? (Y / N)"**** 
* The customer types __yes or no__ if yes the app starts again displaying the table 

if customer types no the app then displays ****Thankyou have a Great day! 

* A link has been provided to view the functionality down below!
